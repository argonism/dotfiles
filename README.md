## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:himkt/dotfiles $HOME/dotfiles
cd $HOME/dotfiles && make
```

### Homebrew/Linuxbrew

If you don't have `brew`, you have to run `make brew` in advance.

- `make brew_cui` and `make brew_cli` builds some essential softwares for me.
- `make brew_gui` is only available on macOS, which builds GUI applications.
